Cocotron XCode Template
=======================

This is an XCode template that can be used to build Win32 applications.

Current known shortcomings:
The SYMROOT configuration is currently hardcoded to my build directory, if anyone
knows how one could go about to add "/Windows" at the end of the default build
directory (even if the user has custom location set in xcode default settings as
I do), I'd be very happy.
